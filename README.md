# Advanced Functional Programming in Scala

This is the repository for exercises for Advanced Functional Programming in
Scala, a LambdaConf workshop taught by @jdegoes.

# Getting Started

Launch SBT and enter incremental compilation mode:

```
sbt
> ~ compile
```

SBT should download all dependencies and compile the source code.

Then open up the `src/main/scala/` directory. You will find one file for each
section of the workshop, and exercises in each file.

# Order of exercises

1. [functions.scala](https://github.com/lukastymo/advanced-fp-in-scala/blob/master/src/main/scala/functions.scala)
2. [types.scala](https://github.com/lukastymo/advanced-fp-in-scala/blob/master/src/main/scala/types.scala)
